"# LSTM-translator-ENG---PL-" 
This translator uses the eng_pl.txt file from http://www.manythings.org/anki/ as the source text file.
The Text_Normalization.py script deals with textual data, where the translated sequences are separated by the tab sign. 
The Train_Model.py script trains the model incorporating the hot encode method and LSTM KERAS layer.The achieved model is fully scalable hence it can be tested on a set of any size.Matplotlib is used for presenting the model performance.
